# QuickMail
Quick Mail - The fastest way to send anonymous emails  
to clear net Domains, through the Tor Network.  

In quickmail-server.go set lines 36,37,153,177,344    
to your own Domain, so that your postfix MTA uses     
the proper values. You can run the server with a     
blacklist or whitelist, so that  your MTA becomes   
not an open relay.  

In the client you don't have to set a From:, Date: or  
Message-ID: and MIME beaders, because the server sets them.  

For a Subject: header containing UTF-8 chars there  
is a MIME button in the lower left, which converts  
your Subject: content to proper MIME base64 encoding.
